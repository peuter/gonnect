# Overview

_GOnnect_ is a simple, easy to use UC client, designed for
Linux / _Flatpak_ based installations. It makes use of various Flatpak
portals and is meant to integrate well into modern Desktop Environments
like _KDE_ or _GNOME_.

![Overview](media/main-screen.png)

What is special about _GOnnect_ is that is meant to be provisioned. For
that reason it has no configuration wizard or settings dialog and
requires a working configuration file in place.

Here's a short feature list:

 * Call forwarding
 * Conference calls with three parties
 * Busy state for supported sources
 * Configurable busy on active call
 * Address sources
   * LDAP
   * CardDAV
   * CSV
   * GNOME Contacts / Evolution Data Service
 * Configurable identities for outgoing calls
 * Configurable Togglers (i.e. for call queues, CFNL, etc.)
 * **Jitsi Meet Integration: Upgrade call to Videoconference**
 * Calendar sources for upcoming conferences
   * CalDAV
   * GNOME Calendar / Evolution Data Service
 * **Support for various hardware headsets (i.e. Yealink, Jabra)**
 * Support for various busylights
 * Custom audio device profiles or managed by your system
 * [mpris](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/) for
   stopping other audio sources on incoming calls
 * System Tray integration for most common functions / favorites / most frequent
   calls
 * GNOME Search-Provider support
 * KRunner search plugin (requires next generation flatpak)
 * Desktop Actions / Autostart
 * Global Keyboard Shortcuts (if supported by your Desktop environment)
 * Keeping the screensaver from droppin' in while on the phone
 * Mime-Type registration for `tel:` / `sip:` URLs
 * Light/Dark mode

# Installing _GOnnect_

_GOnnect_ is distributed via Flathub only. To install it, either visit the
[Flathub page](https://flathub.org/apps/de.gonicus.gonnect), search for _GOnnect_ in _GNOME-Software_
or KDE's _discover_.

After you have installed _GOnnect_, either adjust the provided
`docs/modules/ROOT/examples/sample.conf` and place it in `~/.var/app/de.gonicus.gonnect/config/gonnect/99-user.conf`,
or head over to [the documentation](https://github.com/gonicus/gonnect/wiki).

# Non-goals

Like every other software, _GOnnect_ cannot be an all-purpose silver bullet. Here are some
deliberately chosen non-goals, so things that will not be implemented into _GOnnect_:

* **Full SIP configuration**: Most SIP clients provide a plethora of options to configure
every single bit of the SIP connection. That includes many audio codecs of which most are
obsolete or rarely used. _GOnnect_ strives to be simple and therefore allows only the most
common and important options. This will exclude some exotic ones.
* **PIM/contact management**: This should be done via dedicated PIM services as opposed to
implementing the nth place to store contacts.
* **Speech-to-text transcription and audio recording**: Apart from some technical insufficiencies
this bears some critical questions about data privacy.
* **Conferences with more than three participants**: Ad-hoc conferences are implemented such
that the initializing participant will be a router for the audio streams of the others. In
our experience, having more than three endpoints will produce bad sound quality, delays and
other performance issues. Bigger conferences would require a specific configuration on the
SIP server or another platform (like [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/)).

# Translations

We are using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/gonnect/) to translate GOnnect
in various languages. This hosted service is provided us for free as GOnnect is an Open Source
project. Many thanks to the Weblate team for this!.

Everyone is invited to contribute to the translations. Just head over to our
[Weblate project](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/gonnect/) and start translating.
If you miss a language request a new one at Weblate or
[create an issue at GitHub](https://github.com/gonicus/gonnect/issues/new/choose).

# Development

_GOnnect_ is based on Qt / C++ and requires a set of libraries to be buildable.
There are may ways to achieve a build, but we'll describe just one of them in
the following paragraphs.

## Prerequisites

As we use immutable desktops here at [GONICUS](https://www.gonicus.de) and
development takes place in a dedicated
[distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) for each project, we also use
this procedure for _GOnnect_.

Make sure to have _distrobox_ installed. On _Fedora_ for example run:

```bash
sudo dnf install distrobox
```

After _distrobox_ is installed, create the _distrobox_ for _GOnnect_ development
by running

```bash
distrobox assemble create --name gonnect
```

in the directory of your _GOnnect_ checkout.


## Building

### Unix based systems

Assuming you're using the documented _distrobox_ approach above, enter the _distrobox_
and start the ordinary _CMake_ build:

```bash
distrobox enter gonnect
cd <to where you've cloned this repository>
./resources/conan/export.py
conan install . --build=missing
cmake --preset conan-release .
cmake --build --preset conan-release --parallel $(nproc --all)
```

Alternatively you can simply run `qtcreator` inside the _distrobox_ and open the
project as usual be selecting the `CMakeLists.txt`.


### Building the flatpak

As _GOnnect_ is mainly developed for use in _Flatpak_, some features only work in this
kind of environment. If you want to build the _Flatpak_ locally, you can do this by
the following commands on your host shell:

```bash
flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder org.flatpak.Builder build --user --install-deps-from=flathub --disable-rofiles-fuse --force-clean --repo=repo resources/flatpak/de.gonicus.gonnect.yml
flatpak --user install ./repo de.gonicus.gonnect
```
